**SARscape**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    In `SARscape <https://www.sarmap.ch/index.php/software/sarscape/>`, time series of deformations are generated as shapefiles by enabling the following fields in the specific Geocoding panel or task:
        - In case of **PS/E-PS**  and **E-SBAS** -> “Make geocoded shape”-> True (Yes in the task)
        - In case of **SBAS** -> “Make Geocoded Shape”->  True (Yes in the task)  & “Generate Shape Time Series” ->  True (Yes in the task)

    These options are already set to true by default.
