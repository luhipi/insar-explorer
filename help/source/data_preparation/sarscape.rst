**SARscape**
^^^^^^^^^^^^

  In `SARscape <https://www.sarmap.ch/index.php/software/sarscape/>`_, time series of deformations are generated as shapefiles by enabling the following fields in the specific Geocoding panel or task:

  - In case of PS/E-PS  and E-SBAS -> “Make geocoded shape”-> True (Yes in the task)
  - In case of SBAS -> “Make Geocoded Shape”->  True (Yes in the task)  & “Generate Shape Time Series” ->  True (Yes in the task)
  These options are already set to true in SARscape processing by default.
